        "
        The Detective arrived at the scene of the crime. Yellow police tape fluttered around the crime scene.
        Inside the house, you se the entire family lay motionless on the living room floor, their lifeless eyes staring into nothingness. A mother, a father brutally murdered. Yet, there was one glimmer of hope: the daughter, Sarah, was nowhere to be found. 
        Jack suspects the neighbor: Mr. Thompson. He's the only neighbor not standing in front of the house.
        There are a few evidences found:
        Footprints: Jack noticed a set of muddy footprints leading from Mr. Thompson's yard to the back entrance of the victims' house.
        Witness Testimony: One witness claimed to have heard raised voices coming from Mr. Thompson's house around the time of the crime.
        A handgun, in the hand of Greg, the family's father.
        Mr. Thompson has a few weak spots Jack will discover:
        •	He never had a family, even though he wanted to.
        •	He has a dog, Sparks, that he loves very much.
        •	He is saving for a trip around the world, and he almost saved enough money.
        Mr. Thompson reveals he killed the family after a pitty argument with the father over land. He panicked and killed the mother to leave no trace but couldn't kill the daughter so he locked her in his secret basement, he wanted to create a new family for her and be her new father, as he was sorry for what he had done.
        Racing against the clock, Jack and his team descended into the depths of Mr. Thompson's house. And there, in the darkness, they found her—small, scared, but alive.
        In the end, justice prevailed, but the shadows of deception would forever haunt their memories.

From OpenAI prompt engineering documentation:

Inner monologue is a tactic that can be used to mitigate this. The idea of inner monologue is to instruct the model to put parts of the output that are meant to be hidden from the user into a structured format that makes parsing them easy. Then before presenting the output to the user, the output is parsed and only part of the output is made visible.
